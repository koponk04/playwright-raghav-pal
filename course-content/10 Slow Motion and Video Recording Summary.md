# Summary of 10 Slow Motion and Video Recording.md

In this instructional text, the author, Raghav, introduces features in Playwright that allow users to slow down test execution and record videos of the tests. The process is explained through various chapters:

1. **Introduction**: The chapter outlines the goal of slowing down tests to observe execution better and recording videos, both of which are built into Playwright.

2. **Config Setup**: Users are guided on how to edit the Playwright configuration file to enable video recording and slow motion globally.

3. **Execution**: An example is provided to demonstrate running a test in slow motion and verifying that the video is recorded and appears in the test results. 

4. **Browser Context**: It explains creating an isolated browser context for more granular control, especially useful for multi-window or multi-tab applications.

5. **New Test Creation**: The author discusses creating a new test file specifically for demonstrating slow motion and video recording, stressing the importance of properly closing the browser context after the test.

6. **Configuring at the Test Level**: Instructions are given on how to set up slow motion and video recording settings directly within the test using browser context configurations.

7. **Running the Test**: The text walks through running the created test while ensuring the correct configurations are applied.

8. **Conclusion**: Raghav wraps up by encouraging viewers to reach out with questions and emphasizes continued learning, providing assurance that all steps and links will be available in the video description.

The overall message emphasizes the utility of manipulating execution speed and recording in automated testing using Playwright.
