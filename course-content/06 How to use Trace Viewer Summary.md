# Summary of 06 How to use Trace Viewer.md

### Summary of the Course Content

**Chapter 1: Introduction**
The session focuses on the significance of analyzing test failures in automation testing. It introduces **Trace Viewer** in Playwright, a tool that helps examine test failures by providing snapshots and timelines of the application state at the time of failure.

**Chapter 2: What is Trace Viewer**
Trace Viewer is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to view detailed information about executed tests, including timelines, screenshots, and environment details. The chapter explains how to navigate the Trace Viewer to observe application states before and after actions, facilitating easier troubleshooting.

**Chapter 3: Using Trace Viewer**
Instructions are provided on setting up tracing in the Playwright configuration file, including enabling traces on retries or failures. A practical example demonstrates how to intentionally create a test failure to capture traces for analysis.

**Chapter 4 to 6: Trace Viewer Options**
Various options for configuring tracing are discussed, such as enabling tracing permanently, only on failures, or retaining traces for failed tests. The chapter also covers command-line options for setting trace configurations.

**Chapter 7: Different Ways to View Trace**
The chapter elaborates on various ways to view test traces including accessing them through an HTML report or using the command line to show traces directly from a zip file.

**Chapter 8: Setting Tracing Programmatically**
It describes programmatically setting up tracing within test files, utilizing `context.tracing.start()` and `context.tracing.stop()`. The chapter also touches on the use of hooks for starting and stopping tracing across multiple tests.

**Chapter 9: Conclusion**
The session concludes by encouraging continued learning and suggests participants take a quiz linked in the description. The instructor is open to questions and emphasizes the importance of ongoing education in automation testing. 

Overall, the course provides a detailed exploration of leveraging Playwright's Trace Viewer to enhance test analysis and troubleshoot failures effectively.
