# Summary of 11 Hooks & Groups.md

**Summary of Playwright Hooks and Groups Course:**

In this course, Raghav introduces the concepts of Hooks and Groups in Playwright, focusing on the structure and usage in tests. 

1. **Introduction to Hooks:** Hooks are functions that allow you to run specific steps before or after tests (e.g., `beforeEach`, `afterEach`). They help streamline test setup and teardown procedures.

2. **Hands-On Demo:**
   - A test for logging into a demo website (sourcedemo.com) is created, showing how to use Playwright's functionalities, including the Playwright Inspector for recording steps.
   - Additional tests are developed for interacting with the home page and a logout functioning, emphasizing reusability and the need to eliminate duplicate code.

3. **Optimizing Test Structure:**
   - The course demonstrates how to reduce redundancy by using hooks for repetitive tasks, such as logging in before each test.
   - `afterAll` hooks are introduced for closing the page after all tests have run.

4. **Organizing Tests with Groups:**
   - Tests are grouped using `describe` blocks, allowing specific hooks to apply only to that group. This is beneficial for structured test reporting and management.

5. **Understanding the Execution Order:** Explanation of how the registration order affects the execution of hooks when multiple hooks are defined.

The course concludes with a summary of the functionalities of Hooks and testing organization, and a teaser for future lessons on annotations and tags in Playwright. The emphasis is on best practices in writing clean, efficient tests.
