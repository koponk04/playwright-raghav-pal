## Summary of Playwright Page Object Model Tutorial

### Chapter 1: Introduction
Raghav from automationstepbystep.com introduces a session on creating a Page Object Model (POM) design project using Playwright, beginning from scratch.

### Chapter 2: Step 1 - Create a New Folder
- A new folder named "playwright form demo" is created and opened in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
- The tutorial will guide users in writing a simple test script for a login page.

### Chapter 3: Step 2 - Initialize Node.js Project
- The Node.js project is initialized using `npm init -y`, creating a `package.json` file for dependencies.

### Chapter 4: Step 3 - Install & Setup Playwright
- Playwright is installed via the command `npm init playwright@latest`, selecting JavaScript for the language and setting up a test folder.

### Chapter 5: Step 4 - Create a Demo Login Test
- A demo login test is created using Playwright's test generator tool (`npx playwright codegen`), which allows for recording actions to be automated.

### Chapter 6: Step 5 - Run Tests
- The test is executed using `npx playwright test`, and report generation is demonstrated using `npx playwright show-report`.

### Chapter 7: Step 6 - Create a "pages" Directory
- A "pages" folder is created to adhere to the POM design, separating object locators and actions from the test scripts.

### Chapter 8: Step 7 - Create Page Classes
- A file named `login.js` is created, defining a `LoginPage` class containing locators and action methods for the login functionality.

### Chapter 9: Step 8 - Define Actions in LoginPage Class
- Action methods for conducting login tasks (entering username, password, and clicking the login button) are structured in the `LoginPage` class.

### Chapter 10: Step 9 - Incorporate Page Class in Tests
- The `LoginPage` class is imported into the test file, where an instance is created to facilitate the login actions in tests.

### Chapter 11: Step 10 - Run the Test
- Tests are executed and verified for successful functionality. Common issues are discussed, focusing on the need to adapt for async functions.

### Chapter 12: Upload Project on GitHub
- The project is initialized and uploaded to GitHub, including a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files. Users are encouraged to reach out for questions or assistance.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on setting up a Playwright project using the Page Object Model, enhancing test organization and maintainability.
