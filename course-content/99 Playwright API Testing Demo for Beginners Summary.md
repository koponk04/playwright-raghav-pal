# Summary of 99 Playwright API Testing Demo for Beginners.md

In this tutorial by Raghav, participants will learn API testing using Playwright, covering project setup and various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The course begins with creating a project folder and setting up Playwright in an IDE (VS Code). After initializing the project, users will learn how to create and run a simple GET request, validate responses, and use assertions to check HTTP status codes and response content.

Subsequently, participants will engage with POST requests, which include payloads, and learn to assert responses after sending data. The tutorial proceeds to cover PUT requests, emphasizing the importance of understanding the difference between PUT and PATCH for updating resources. Finally, users will handle DELETE requests and check for successful status codes.

Throughout the course, Raghav highlights the available features in Playwright's UI, such as viewing test reports and leveraging a comprehensive set of assertions for API responses. Attendees are encouraged to reference the official Playwright documentation for deeper insights and to practice hands-on coding to solidify their learning.
