# Summary of 08 Demo Login Test.md

**Summary:**

In this course, the instructor Raghav demonstrates how to create login tests using the Playwright automation tool across several demo applications. 

1. **Introduction**: Raghav welcomes participants and outlines the plan to create a sample login test and utilize demo applications.

2. **Demo Applications**: Tests are performed on demo sites like demo.epitools.com, Orange HRM, and no commerce.com, focusing on different login pages.

3. **First Login Test**: Participants are guided through creating a login test using VS Code by importing necessary libraries and writing a test script. Steps include navigating to the login page, inspecting elements to find locators, filling in credentials, and executing the test.

4. **Commands for Element Availability**: Raghav explains how Playwright inherently manages waiting for elements to be present before interaction. Custom timeout settings can be configured in the configuration file for specific cases.

5. **Second Login Test**: A second demostral test is created for the Orange HRM application, where locators are found and actions added using the Playwright inspector.

6. **Third Login Test**: Lastly, a third test for the no commerce.com application is conducted, showing how to record actions directly within the Playwright inspector, including using keyboard shortcuts to interact with fields.

Through hands-on examples, participants learn to automate login tests effectively using Playwright, with encouragement for further exploration and practice.
